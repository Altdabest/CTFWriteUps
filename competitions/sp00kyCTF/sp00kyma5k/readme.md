# sp00ky ma5k

Before the competition there was an announcement that there was going to a be a physical prize for the team that completed the challenge first. Our team before the competition began decided we wanted to win the prize, so as soon as we had enough points immediately bought both hints for a combined 50 points making the challenge worth no points.

To start of the challenge we were given this hint and a text files called masks

```txt
Everyone loves a good sp00KY! mask on halloween but I can never decide between one so I end up buying 7. Anyway, I don't want to wear the same mask as my L33T Hack3r friends but I cant seem to crack the code to figure out what maskes that they are planning to wear. Help me crack the code and you can have a mask from my extensive collection.

note there are three flags in this file but they do not have a flag tag you must append them with an underscore using the following format.
submit sp00ky{<alicePlaintext>_<bobPlaintext>_<evePlaintext>} 
```

alice:$1$xbl0l1zU$Ur0MUnbko2XgpXhVxZ3430

eve:$1$b8YPC.ff$v3xunqpTNTy6IgvJu1yZO1
