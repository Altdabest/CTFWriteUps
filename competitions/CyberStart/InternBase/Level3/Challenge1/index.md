Intern, the agency have been in contact with a rival hacker to a new, secretive gang of hackers who goes by the name "ROXy". She specializes in short, cryptic, hard to decipher secret codes.

ROXy is willing to work with us... if we can prove we're as smart as she is. Before she'll hand over any information, she's given us a code to break first.

If you can help us break this code, we'll gain an important new informant.

Tip: The flag is the secret code.

The page shows an email with 2 hex values ```0xB105F00D``` and ```0xAAA8400A```, saying they got them from ROXy which was a hint to XOR the string whcih I used an online calculator to do and got the string ```0x1badb007``` which is the flag.
