We've been informed that a group of hackers are communicating cryptically on a social media site.

Their messages have been getting increasingly cryptic; so much so that all of the posts now look jumbled up and don't seem to make any sense!

We've found one post that we believe contains an important secret, and we need you to find out what that secret is so we can be ready to stop a possible cyber attack!

Tip: The secret is the flag.

The secret is just text that has been reversed which is ```time4hackattack```
